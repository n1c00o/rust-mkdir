# rust-mkdir

This repository contains a `mkdir` like command written in Rust.

I made this to learn Rust, please refer to [this](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/uu/mkdir/src/mkdir.rs) if 
you need a better `mkdir` in Rust!

Please note that the program does not support permissions changing using the `--mode` flag.
